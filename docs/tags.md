# Tags

This document explains the tagging system used in your project for Cypress and Cucumber tests.

---

In our Cypress and Cucumber setup, tags are used to categorize and selectively run tests. They can be applied at various levels, including `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, and `Examples`. Tags applied at a higher level are inherited by all child elements, unless overridden by more specific tags. The following tags we are currently using in our framework:

**Tag Descriptions**

- **@stable_test:** These tests are considered stable and are expected to run successfully in both the staging and school API environments.
  <br>

- **@regression_test:** This tag is used for tests that are run against both the dev (32.41...) and staging environments before a release.
  <br>

- **@school_api_test:** This tag is specific to tests that interact with the school API.
  <br>

- **@staging_test:** Tests marked with this tag are specific to the staging environment.
  <br>

- **@pr:** Tests tagged with @pr are executed as part of the CI process for Pull Requests. These tests provide quick feedback on the stability of changes before merging.
  <br>

- **@unstable_test:** These are tests that have been identified as unstable. They may fail intermittently due to issues in either the staging or development environments. This tag helps in identifying flaky tests that require attention.
  <br>

- **@group-X:** Used to group test files for parallel execution in CI. This helps divide tests across multiple runners for faster test execution.
Examples: @group-A, @group-B, @group-C ...etc.

  <br>

- **@schedule_run**: This tag is designated for running all tests during a scheduled run that are currently in a Pull Request (PR) and are considered strong candidates for inclusion in the PR's workflow, also known as the remote workflow. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance and stability of these tests within the Continuous Integration (CI) environment. If these tests perform well and demonstrate stability, they will be added to the PR's workflow, ensuring that future PRs benefit from these validated tests.
  <br>

- **@clean_up_staging_test_data:** This tag is used for a test run, which removes all courses that were created by cancelled or failed test runs before. This is only for staging / ref environment and not for dev environments (where it is not needed, since the test school is always created new for each test).
  <br>

- **@localhost_test:** For running tests locally, this tag must be used.

## Tag Hierarchy and Inheritance

Tags applied at the `Feature` level are inherited by all scenarios within that feature. For example, if a `Feature` is tagged with `@regression_test`, all scenarios under that feature are also considered part of the release unless explicitly marked otherwise. This hierarchy allows for efficient and consistent application of test conditions across multiple tests.

## Examples

### @regression_test and @stable_test

```cucumber
@regression_test
Feature: Account Management

  @stable_test
  Scenario: Edit email as an internal user
    Given I am logged in as an internal user at the organization
    When I navigate to the account settings page
    Then I should see that my email address is editable
```

_Explanation_:

- The `@regression_test` tag at the `Feature` level indicates that all scenarios in this feature are part of the release test suite.
- The `@stable_test` tag on the specific scenario indicates that this test is reliable and expected to pass in all environments.

### @unstable_test

```cucumber
@unstable_test
Feature: Add-ons Management

  Scenario Outline: Access Add-ons page
    Given I am logged in as a '<user_role>' in the '<namespace>'
    When I navigate to the Add-ons page
    Then I should see the Add-ons interface

    Examples:
      | user_role | namespace |
      | admin     | main      |
      | teacher   | main      |
      | student   | main      |
```

_Explanation_:

- The `@unstable_test` tag applied at the `Feature` level marks the entire feature as potentially unstable. This is useful for tracking tests that may fail intermittently due to environmental or other issues.

### @school_api_test and @staging_test

```cucumber
@regression_test
@stable_test
Feature: User Management

  Scenario: Admin adds, edits, and deletes a user
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    When I add a new user with specific details
    Then the user should be visible in the user list
    When I edit the user's details
    Then the updated information should be displayed
    When I delete the user
    Then the user should no longer appear in the user list

  @school_api_test
  Examples: School API Environment
    | namespace | admin  | user_role | user_email               | new_user_email          |
    | school    | admin1 | student   | student@school.com | updated_student@school.com |

  @staging_test
  Examples: Staging Environment
    | namespace | admin  | user_role | user_email               | new_user_email          |
    | staging   | admin2 | teacher   | teacher@staging.com | updated_teacher@staging.com |
```

_Explanation_:

- The `@regression_test` and `@stable_test` tags are applied at the `Feature` level, indicating that all scenarios are part of stable, release-ready tests.
- The `@school_api_test` and `@staging_test` tags are applied to specific examples to denote testing in different environments, demonstrating selective tagging at the `Examples` level.

### @pr

```cucumber
@pr
Feature: Critical Paths

  Scenario: Verify homepage loads correctly
    Given the application is deployed
    When I navigate to the homepage
    Then the homepage should load all critical components without errors
```

_Explanation_:

- The `@pr` tag indicates that this scenario is crucial for CI/CD pipelines, specifically for validating changes made in Pull Requests. This tag helps ensure that core functionalities are not broken by new code.

## Summary

This documentation provides an overview of tag usage and hierarchy in our testing framework. Tags applied at higher levels, such as `Feature`, affect all nested scenarios unless more specific tags are applied. This hierarchical tagging system allows for efficient test management and selective execution, tailored to different environments and testing needs.
