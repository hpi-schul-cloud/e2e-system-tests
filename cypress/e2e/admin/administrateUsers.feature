Feature: Admin - To add, edit and delete new users by the admin.

    As an admin I want to create a new user so that I can administrate it

    Scenario Outline: Adding a new user, edit and delete this user

        # pre-condition: admin adds a new student and a new teacher
        Given I am logged in as a '<admin>' at '<namespace>'
        When I click on administration in menu
        When I go to '<role_to_manage>' administration
        When I click on FAB
        When I click on Add User in opened FAB for '<role_to_manage>'
        When I fill out the user creation form for '<user_first_name>' '<user_last_name>' with email '<user_email>'
        When I click on add button to add '<role_to_manage>'
        When I enter '<role_to_manage>' email '<user_email>' in search input field
        Then I can see the user with email '<user_email>' in the table

        # admin adds edits a student and a teacher
        When I go to '<role_to_manage>' administration
        When I enter '<role_to_manage>' email '<user_email>' in search input field
        When I click edit '<role_to_manage>' button for '<user_email>'
        When I change username to '<user_first_name_edited>' '<user_last_name_edited>'
        When I change email to '<user_email_edited>'
        When I click save changes button
        When I enter '<role_to_manage>' email '<user_email_edited>' in search input field
        Then I can see the user with email '<user_email_edited>' in the table
        When I enter '<role_to_manage>' email '<user_email>' in search input field
        Then I can not see user '<user_email>' in the table

        # admin reverts teacher user information (Note: This scenario can be further implemented)
        #When I am on the teachers management page
        #When I go to teacher edit page for '<user_first_name>' with email '<user_email>'
        #When I Change the name to '<user_first_name>' '<user_first_name_edited>'
        #When I  Change the email to '<user_email>'
        #Then I can save the changes

        # post-condition: admin deletes a student and a teacher
        When I go to '<role_to_manage>' administration
        When I enter '<role_to_manage>' email '<user_email_edited>' in search input field
        When I click edit '<role_to_manage>' button for '<user_email_edited>'
        When I click delete user button to delete user with last name '<user_last_name_edited>'
        When I click on delete button in pop up
        When I enter '<role_to_manage>' email '<user_email_edited>' in search input field
        Then I can not see user '<user_email_edited>' in the table
