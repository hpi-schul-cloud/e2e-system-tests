Feature: Room Administration - Add room and external members with visibility on rooms administration page

    As a school admin I want to see the created rooms with correct information visible on rooms administration page.

    Scenario: Admin sees room with external members, including pre-conditions
        # cypress-test-school-2
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacherExt>' at '<namespace>'
        # cypress-test-school-1
        Given I am logged in as a '<admin>' at '<namespace>'
        # cypress-test-school-1
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'

        # pre-condition: external teacher activates visibility in central directory in different school (cypress-test-school-2)
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacherExt>' at '<namespace>'
