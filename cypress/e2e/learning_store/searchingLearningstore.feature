    Scenario: Search, open and download material form learning store, including pre-condition

        # pre-condition: admin, student and teacher log in to create their account in a same school
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'
        Given I am logged in as a '<student>' at '<namespace>'
        Given I am logged in as a '<admin>' at '<namespace>'
