Feature: Team - Student managed teams

    As a student I want to create/edit/delete the team so that I can manage the team. This is not possible for NBC, because there students are generally not allowed to create teams.

    Scenario: student creates, edits and deletes team
        # as a pre-condition create teacher and student
        Given I am logged in as a '<admin>' at '<namespace>'
        Given I am logged in as a '<student>' at '<namespace>'
        # pre-condition: admin allows student to create a team
        # in nbc students generally are allowed to create a team - there is no checkbox for admin to manage this - has to be adapted
        Given I am logged in as a '<admin>' at '<namespace>'
        When I click on administration in menu
        When I go to team administration
        When I click the checkbox to allow students to create a team
        When I click on Save
        Then I see checkbox is saved

        # student creates team
        Given I am logged in as a '<student>' at '<namespace>'
        When I go to teams overview
        When I click on button Add Team on the teams overview page
        Then I see new team creation page
        When I enter in the title '<team_title>'
        When I enter in the description '<team_description>'
        When I select the team colour black
        Then I click on button Create Team on the team creation page
        When I go to teams overview
        Then I see team title '<team_title>' is visible
        Then I see the description '<team_description>' is visible

        # student edits team
        When I go to a team '<team_title>'
        When I click on team settings
        When I click on edit option
        Then I see team edit page
        When I enter in the title '<team_title_edited>'
        When I enter in the description '<team_description_edited>'
        When I click on teams save changes button
        When I go to teams overview
        Then I see team title '<team_title_edited>' is visible
        Then I see the description '<team_description_edited>' is visible

        # student deletes team
        When I go to a team '<team_title_edited>'
        When I click on team settings
        When I click on delete option
        Then I see dialog box and click on delete button to confirm the deletion
        Then I do not see the team '<team_title_edited>'
