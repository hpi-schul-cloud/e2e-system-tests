# Note: This feature can not be currently executed using the school API, as creating two different school within the same scenario is not possible. And creating them in two different scenarios results in separate sessions, which prevents the copied board URL from the first scenario from being used in the second scenario.

Feature: Room Board - Share multi-column board in the rooms with the teacher from different school

    As a teacher, I want to share a multi-column board with another teacher from a different school so that I can collaborate effectively.

    Scenario Outline: Share a multi-column board with a teacher from differentschool

        # pre-condition: creating teacher accounts for two different schools
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacherExt_1>' at '<namespace>'

        # pre-condition: room and multi-column board are available in the first school
        Given a room named '<room_name_source>' exists
        Given a multi-column board named '<board_title>' exists in the room

        # first teacher from the first school allows sharing the multi-column board with another teacher from a different school
