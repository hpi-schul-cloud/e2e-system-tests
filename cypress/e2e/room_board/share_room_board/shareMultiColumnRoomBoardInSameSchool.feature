Feature: Room Board - Share multi-column room board in the rooms with teacher from the same school

    As a teacher, I want to share a multi-column board with another teacher within the same school so that I can collaborate effectively.

    Scenario Outline: Share a multi-column board with a Teacher within the same school

        # pre-condition: creating teacher accounts
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher2>' at '<namespace>'
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher1>' at '<namespace>'

        # pre-condition: room and multi-column board exist
        Given a room named '<room_name_source>' exists
        Given a multi-column board named '<board_title>' exists in the room

        # first teacher shares the multi-column board with another teacher in the same school using the copied URL

        Given a room named '<room_name_target>' exists

        # second teacher within the same school imports the multi-column board
