Feature: Room Board - Add bettermarks Tool in the Room Board

    As a teacher, I want to integrate the bettermarks external CTL tool into the room board so that I can seamlessly assign and track learning tasks with students.

    Scenario Outline: Add, edit, delete bettermarks Tool to the Room Board, including pre & post conditions

        # pre-condition: creating accounts
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'
        Given I am logged in as a '<student>' at '<namespace>'
        Given I am logged in as a '<admin>' at '<namespace>'

        # pre-condition: admin adds bettermarks tool in school settings page as an External Tool
        Given the school has external tool '<bettermarks_title>'

        # pre-condition: teacher adds student and room and boards are existing
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'
        Given a room named '<room_name>' exists
        Given student '<student_name>' with role '<student_role>' from school '<student_school>' added to the room '<room_name>'
        Given I navigate to the room detail page via Breadcrumb
        Given a multi-column board named '<board_title>' exists in the room
        Given the multi-column board has a column with a card

        # teacher adds bettermarks Tool to the multi-column board
        When I click on the page outside of the column
        When I click on the three dot on the card

        # clicking on the bettermarks tool even with stubbing causing unstable error, so this step is commented out and is for manual testing part.
        #Then I click on the bettermarks element in the card
