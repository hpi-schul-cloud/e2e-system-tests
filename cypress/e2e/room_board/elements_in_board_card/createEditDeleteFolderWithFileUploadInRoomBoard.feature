Feature: Room Board - Create, edit and delete folder in board, including file handling inside the folder

    As a content editor, I want to create a file folder in a room board so that I can manage the files in the room.

    Scenario Outline:  Content editor is able to create, edit and delete a folder in a board

        # pre-condition: creating accounts and room with board
        Given I am logged in as a '<content_editor>' at '<namespace>'
        Given a room named '<room_name>' exists
        Given a multi-column board named '<board_title>' exists in the room
        Given the multi-column board has a column with a card

        # content editor creates a folder element in the card
        When I click on the page outside of the column
        When I click on the three dot on the card
        When I click on the option Edit in the three dot menu on the card
        When I click on icon Plus to add content into card
        When I select 'file-folder' from the element selection dialog box
        When I enter name '<folder_name_edited>' for file folder in card
        When I click outside of the card to save it
        Then I see a folder with name '<folder_name_edited>' in the card

        # editor removes folder name and name is reset to previous folder name
        When I click on the page outside of the column
        When I click on the three dot on the card
        When I click on the option Edit in the three dot menu on the card
        When I clear folder name in card
        When I click outside of the card to save it
        When I click on the page outside of the column
        Then I see a folder with name '<folder_name_edited>' in the card

        # editor changes folder name without saving on room page
        When I click on the three dot on the card
        When I click on the option Edit in the three dot menu on the card
        When I enter name '<folder_name_edited>' for file folder in card
        When I click on the page outside of the column
        Then I see a folder with name '<folder_name_edited>' in the card

        # editor renames folder on room page
        When I click on the three dot on the card
        When I click on the option Edit in the three dot menu on the card
        When I enter name '<folder_name_edited>' for file folder in card
        When I click outside of the card to save it

        Then I see a folder with name '<folder_name_edited>' in the card
