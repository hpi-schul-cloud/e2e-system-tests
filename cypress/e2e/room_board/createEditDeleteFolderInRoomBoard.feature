Feature: Room Board - Create, edit and delete folder in board, including file handling inside the folder (in progress)

As a content editor I want to create a file folder in a room board

Scenario Outline:  Content editor is able to create, edit and delete a folder in a board
        # pre-condition: creating accounts and room with board
        Given I am logged in as a '<content_editor>' at '<namespace>'
        Given a room named '<room_name>' exists
        Given a multi-column board named '<board_title>' exists in the room
        Given the multi-column board has a column with a card

        # content editor creates a folder element in the card
        When I click on the page outside of the column
        When I click on the three dot on the card
        When I click on the option Edit in the three dot menu on the card
        When I click on icon Plus to add content into card
        When I select 'file-folder' from the element selection dialog box
        Then I see a folder with name '<folder_name>' in the card

        # content editor opens folder
        When I click on the folder '<folder_name>' in the card
        Then I see page Folder content for '<folder_name>'
        Then I see message Empty folder
        #Then I see page Folder content does not contain files - will be implemented when files can be displayed in folders
        Then I see breadcrumb with 'RÃ¤ume, <room_name>, <board_title>'
        Then I see button Add file

        # post-condition: delete the room
        Given the room named '<room_name>' is deleted
