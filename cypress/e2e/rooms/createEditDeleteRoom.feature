Feature: Room - To create, edit and delete room

    As a teacher I want to create, edit and delete rooms.

    Scenario: Teacher creates room, edits room and deletes room, including pre-conditions where applicable
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'

        # teacher creates a new room
        When I go to room overview
        When I click on FAB to create new room
        Then I see room creation page
        When I enter the room name '<room_name>'
        When I select the colour for the room
        When I select the start date for the room
        When I select the end date for the room
        When I click on the button to save the room
        Then I see the detail page of room '<room_name>'

        # teacher is able to edit the room
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'
        When I go to room overview
        When I go to room '<room_name>'
        Then I see the detail page of room '<room_name>'
        When I click on three dot menu in room page
        When I click on edit option in room menu
        Then I see edit page of room '<room_name>'
        When I enter the room name '<room_name_new>'
        When I click on the button to save the room
        Then I see the detail page of room '<room_name_new>'

        # teacher is able to delete the room
        Given I am logged in as a '<teacher>' at '<namespace>'
        When I go to room overview
        When I go to room '<room_name_new>'
